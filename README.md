The tool is split between the memory compiler and memory decompiler.

* Directory `compiler/` has the memory compiler with automated mapper.
* Directory `decompiler/` has the memory decompiler with two implementations, the theoretically complete baseline, and the less complete but faster decompiler which incorporates some heuristics.
